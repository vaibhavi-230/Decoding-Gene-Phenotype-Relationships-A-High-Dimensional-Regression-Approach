# Decoding-Gene-Phenotype-Relationships-A-High-Dimensional-Regression-Approach


In this project, I explored the relationship between gene expression and phenotype by leveraging advanced statistical and machine learning techniques. The workflow included evaluating the feasibility of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), assessing the necessity of an intercept, and applying a correlation-based filtering method to reduce dimensionality.
High-dimensional regression approaches, including Ridge and Lasso regression are compared to refine model performance. 


**Key Achievements:**

1. Investigated gene significance on phenotype and determined OLS feasibility.

2. Applied correlation-based screening to reduce gene dimensions effectively.

3. Compared Ridge and Lasso regression, showcasing strengths and limitations.

4. Impemented Lasso Regression for its ability to perform automatic feature selection, because it selects a sparse subset of influential genes, enhancing model interpretability in the high-dimensional setting.
